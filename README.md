CIS27 Final Project Code.

Both Java files were written in IntelliJ IDEA. Inspired by a program I made in CIS36A(JAVA) to generate random mazes using union-find.

MazeGeneratorA.java was written in CIS36A of Spring2024, randomly generated maze is visually printed into console after running.
MazeGameWithEnemy.java was written in CIS27 of Fall2025, implements MazeGeneratorA to create perfect maze, then knocks down walls to create loops.
